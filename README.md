# ML-Internship-Task-1
Following is the project based on Iris dataset classification done using python. 
The dataset is read using pandas and then various histograms and scatterplots are displayed. 
The data is then divided into training and testing sets. We use the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to train our model and display its accuracy. 
Finally, a prediction is made on a new dataset entered by the user.
